This is a modified version for pygame, where I created Alhamdulilah things I feel needing everytime I used pygame.

features included: 
    - an Animation and AnimationSet classes to handle the animations.
        you can: 
            * create an single animation
            * create an animation set
            * add a frame to an animation 
            * add a frame or an animation to an animation set, in an old animation or as a new one 
            * retreive the surface to plot
            * define the frame rate for each animation set
            * 
    - a class to handle interaction between objects that are two many, implementing some algorithm to reduce the interaction complexity, and enhance the games that are based on interaction.
    - a class to handle board games, with all tools needed to implement one.
    - a class to facilitate scaling to be an online game.
    - a decorator to force using a method for a limited number of times per instance, to prevent putting methods in the game loop by accident
    - a Window class to facilitate creating the game window, and creating objects in it, can be treated as a Surface object though
