This is a modified version for pygame, where I created Alhamdulilah things I feel needing everytime I used pygame.

features included: 
    - a class to handle the animations.
    - a class to handle interaction between objects that are two many, implementing some algorithm to reduce the interaction complexity, and enhance the games that are based on interaction.
    - a class to handle board games, with all tools needed to implement one.
    - a class to facilitate scaling to be an online game.
    - tools to stop confusing loop methods and initialisation methods represented by a decorator to force using a method a limited number of times per instance
